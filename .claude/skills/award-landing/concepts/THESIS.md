# Developing a Singular Concept

The difference between SOTD and "nice site" is conceptual clarity. Before any visuals, develop a thesis.

## The 4 Questions

### 1. What's the single truth about this brand?

Not what they do — what they ARE. Extract ONE essential quality.

| Brief Says | Single Truth |
|------------|--------------|
| "We make project management software" | "Clarity amidst chaos" |
| "Luxury Swiss watches since 1892" | "Time as art, not utility" |
| "A meditation app for busy people" | "Stillness is accessible" |
| "Creative agency specializing in branding" | "We make the invisible visible" |

The truth is never the product. It's the transformation or belief.

### 2. What metaphor embodies this truth?

Map the abstract truth to something tangible:

| Truth | Metaphor | Visual Implications |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Precision | Watchmaking | Mechanical details, slow motion, gold accents |
| Speed | Wind/Air | Motion blur, flowing lines, lightness |
| Trust | Architecture | Grid, structure, weight, permanence |
| Joy | Playground | Bright colors, bouncy physics, surprise |
| Clarity | Water | Transparency, reflection, calm surfaces |
| Craft | Workshop | Textures, warm materials, human touch |

The metaphor guides every design decision.

### 3. What feeling persists after the user leaves?

Not during — AFTER. The residue.

| Type of Site | Target Feeling |
|--------------|----------------|
| Luxury brand | Elevated, cultured, part of something exclusive |
| Developer tool | Capable, efficient, in good hands |
| Creative agency | Impressed, curious, wanting to work with them |
| Consumer app | Delighted, lighter, eager to use it |
| Product launch | Wanting, convinced, ready to buy |

Design backward from this feeling.

### 4. What's the Signature Moment?

One interaction that embodies the concept. The thing they'll screenshot.

| Brand | Signature Moment | Why It Works |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Cartier | Light ray product reveal | Mimics real jewelry sparkle |
| Ponpon Mania | Candy physics you can throw | Playful brand = playful interaction |
| Terminal Industries | ASCII art hero | Technical brand = technical aesthetic |
| Slosh Seltzer | Liquid follows cursor | Product IS liquid |

The signature moment is where metaphor becomes interaction.

## Concept Development Exercise

For any brief, complete this:

```
BRAND: [Name]

SINGLE TRUTH: [One essential quality]

METAPHOR: [Tangible embodiment]

RESIDUE FEELING: [What persists after]

SIGNATURE MOMENT: [The screenshot-worthy interaction]

THEREFORE: [How this guides every decision]
```

### Example: Flux (Developer Productivity Tool)

```
BRAND: Flux

SINGLE TRUTH: "Flow state, protected"

METAPHOR: Water — continuous, adapting, finding the path

RESIDUE FEELING: Capable, focused, like I have a superpower

SIGNATURE MOMENT: Tasks flow like water between columns, 
with fluid physics on drag

THEREFORE: 
- Soft, fluid motion (no hard stops)
- Cool blue palette (water association)
- Minimal UI (nothing to break flow)
- Typography: clean, effortless, invisible
```

## Common Concept Mistakes

### 1. No Concept (Just Vibes)
"Modern and clean" isn't a concept. It's decoration. Every competitor is "modern and clean."

### 2. Too Many Concepts
"We're innovative, trustworthy, playful, AND premium" = nothing. Pick ONE.

### 3. Concept Doesn't Connect to Product
A banking app with playground metaphor? Disconnect. The concept must feel earned.

### 4. Concept Without Expression
Having a thesis but not expressing it visually. If you removed the copy, would the concept still be visible?

## The Concept Filter

Once you have a concept, every decision passes through it:

> "Does this [color/font/animation/layout] serve the concept, or is it just here because it looks cool?"

If the answer is "just looks cool," remove it.

Award-winning design is about REMOVAL, not addition. Subtract until only the essential remains.
