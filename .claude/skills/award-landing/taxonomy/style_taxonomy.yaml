# Usage guidelines
guidelines:
  assignment:
    - Each site should be assigned to exactly one primary cluster
    - Use the most dominant characteristic for assignment
    - When in doubt, consider the primary user impression

  retrieval:
    - Match user references against cluster keywords first
    - Use exemplar sites as anchors for similarity scoring
    - Blend attributes from multiple clusters when brief spans styles

  generation:
    - Direction Pack should reference cluster definitions for consistency
    - Motion regime from cluster informs MOTION.md generation
    - Typography and palette tendencies seed TOKENS.json generation
