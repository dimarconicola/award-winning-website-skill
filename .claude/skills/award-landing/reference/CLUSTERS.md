## minimal-saas
Clean, restrained product pages. The content sells.

**Exemplars:** Linear, Raycast, Height, Cron Calendar
**Typography:** Geometric sans (Geist, Inter), modest scale
**Color:** Neutral dominant, single accent for CTAs
**Motion:** Subtle fade-ups, refined hover states
**Layout:** Generous whitespace, centered sections, feature grids

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- Obsessive attention to micro-details
- Typography hierarchy is perfect
- Motion so subtle you barely notice, but feels premium

**Common failure:** Boring. No signature moment. Could be any SaaS.

---

## cinematic-hero
Film-inspired with immersive imagery and dramatic reveals.

**Exemplars:** Studio Santi, Locomotive, Porsche, Fantasy
**Typography:** Condensed display, dramatic scale jumps
**Color:** Dark dominant, high contrast moments
**Motion:** Scroll-driven reveals, slow crossfades, video integration
**Layout:** Full-bleed hero, horizontal sections, theatrical pacing

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- The scroll feels like watching a film
- Product/brand is the protagonist
- Motion has rhythm: tension, release

**Common failure:** Overwhelming. Motion never stops. Where's the info?

---

## editorial-magazine
Magazine layouts, strong type hierarchy, content-first.

**Exemplars:** Pentagram, Readymag, Squarespace, Cargo
**Typography:** Serif display + sans body, dramatic size contrast
**Color:** Light/paper backgrounds, ink-like text
**Motion:** Minimal, maybe kinetic headlines
**Layout:** Multi-column, pull quotes, image-text interplay

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- Typography IS the design
- Content feels important, worth reading
- Layouts break grid intentionally, not randomly

**Common failure:** Too busy. Fighting for attention. No rest.

---

## playful-brand
Vibrant, personality-driven, bold colors.

**Exemplars:** Figma, Arc Browser, Mailchimp, Glossier
**Typography:** Rounded or quirky sans, expressive
**Color:** Saturated, multi-color, gradients welcome
**Motion:** Bouncy, stagger, scale pops, physics
**Layout:** Overlapping elements, tilted cards, asymmetry

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- Memorable immediately
- Interactions are surprising and fun
- Personality in every detail

**Common failure:** Childish. Chaos without cohesion. Where's the brand?

---

## futuristic-tech
Gradients, glass effects, dark with neon accents.

**Exemplars:** Vercel, Framer, Nothing, Spotify Wrapped
**Typography:** Clean sans, sometimes geometric display
**Color:** Dark bg, gradient accents, glassmorphism
**Motion:** Smooth, continuous, often cursor-led
**Layout:** Card-based, glowing borders, depth layers

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- Feels like the future, not a concept of it
- Technical craft visible but not show-offy
- Cohesive system, not random effects

**Common failure:** All effects, no content. Slow. Gimmicky.

---

## luxury-premium
Refined, premium, elegant and slow.

**Exemplars:** Bang & Olufsen, Aesop, Cartier, Superhuman
**Typography:** Elegant serif, thin weights, generous spacing
**Color:** Muted, warm neutrals, metallic accents
**Motion:** Deliberate, slow, never rushed
**Layout:** Product as hero, dramatic whitespace, split layouts

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- Feels expensive before you see a price
- Motion says "we respect your time"
- Every detail rewards close inspection

**Common failure:** Slow to the point of boring. No payoff.

---

## brutal-raw
Stark, exposed, anti-design aesthetic.

**Exemplars:** Pentagram, Sagmeister Walsh, Terminal Industries
**Typography:** Monospace exclusively, strict adherence
**Color:** Black/white dominant, one highlight
**Motion:** Instant or none. No flourish.
**Layout:** Visible grid, exposed structure

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- The restraint IS the statement
- Authenticity over polish
- When it breaks convention, it knows the rules

**Common failure:** Lazy, not intentional. Just "didn't design it."

---

## artisanal-craft
Handmade, organic textures, warm and human.

**Exemplars:** Craft, Analogue, Allbirds, Patagonia
**Typography:** Humanist fonts, organic weight variation
**Color:** Earth tones, warm palette, natural materials
**Motion:** Organic, breathing, nothing mechanical
**Layout:** Asymmetric but balanced, photography-forward

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- Feels like a person made it, not a template
- Warmth comes through digitally
- Texture and material are designed

**Common failure:** Generic "eco" aesthetic. Stock nature photos.

---

## experimental-art
Boundary-pushing, memorable, unexpected.

**Exemplars:** Resn, Sagmeister Walsh, Teenage Engineering
**Typography:** Rule-breaking, sometimes illegible (intentionally)
**Color:** Anything goes if cohesive
**Motion:** Unusual, generative, cursor-led
**Layout:** Unconventional, challenges expectations

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- You remember it a week later
- Breaks rules to make a point
- Technical craft enables the concept

**Common failure:** Weird for weird's sake. Unusable. Show-off.

---

## technical-data
Information-dense, systematic, precision-focused.

**Exemplars:** Stripe, Webflow, Linear (docs), Google Cloud
**Typography:** System-like, multiple hierarchy levels
**Color:** Functional, color codes meaning
**Motion:** Purposeful transitions, state clarity
**Layout:** Dense but organized, tabs/sections

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- Complex information made clear
- System is visible and learnable
- Details reveal depth on inspection

**Common failure:** Just documentation. No craft. No perspective.

---

## product-hero
Product-centric, feature-benefit, conversion-optimized.

**Exemplars:** Apple, Sonos, Tesla, Rivian
**Typography:** Clean, serves the product
**Color:** Product colors dominant
**Motion:** Product as protagonist (rotate, reveal, demo)
**Layout:** Scroll-driven product sequences, feature sections

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- You WANT the product
- Motion serves understanding, not decoration
- Every scroll reveals value

**Common failure:** Generic landing page. Product not hero.

---

## agency-portfolio
Case study focus, distinctive display type, work-forward.

**Exemplars:** Basic Agency, Locomotive, Fantasy, Studio Santi
**Typography:** Distinctive display, often custom
**Color:** Usually minimal, work provides color
**Motion:** Page transitions, hover interactions on work
**Layout:** Work grid, case study templates, horizontal galleries

**What makes it award-worthy:**
- The portfolio IS the proof
- Personality in navigation/transitions
- Work speaks, chrome is quiet

**Common failure:** Agency is louder than the work. Gimmicks over cases.
