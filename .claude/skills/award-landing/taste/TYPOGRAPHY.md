# Typography-First Design

Type is 80% of design. The typeface IS the design. Choose it first, let it drive everything else.

## The Hierarchy

1. **Display** — Headlines, hero text, statement moments
2. **Body** — Paragraphs, descriptions, UI text  
3. **Mono** — Data, code, technical content (optional)

That's it. Three roles maximum.

## Type as Brand Signal

Typography communicates before anyone reads a word.

| Type Choice | What It Says |
|-------------|--------------|
| Geometric sans (Inter, Geist) | Modern, systematic, tech-forward |
| Humanist sans (Söhne, Untitled) | Approachable, refined, considered |
| Grotesk (Syne, Space Grotesk) | Bold, editorial, opinionated |
| Serif (Cormorant, Playfair) | Elegant, timeless, premium |
| Slab serif (Roboto Slab) | Sturdy, trustworthy, grounded |
| Monospace (JetBrains, Fira) | Technical, raw, developer-focused |
| Display (Bebas, Oswald) | Dramatic, loud, statement |

The wrong typeface sabotages everything else.

## The Scale System

Don't pick sizes arbitrarily. Use a mathematical scale.

### Minimal Scale (1.25 ratio)
Subtle jumps. Sophisticated. Good for: editorial, luxury.
- 14 → 18 → 22 → 28 → 35 → 44

### Moderate Scale (1.333 ratio)
Balanced jumps. Versatile. Good for: most sites.
- 14 → 19 → 25 → 33 → 44 → 59

### Dramatic Scale (1.5 ratio)
Bold jumps. Statement. Good for: cinematic, bold.
- 14 → 21 → 32 → 48 → 72 → 108

Pick a scale. Use those sizes only. No in-betweens.

## Spacing as Typography

The space around type is as designed as the type itself.

### Letter-Spacing Signals
| Spacing | Effect | When to Use |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Tight (-0.02em) | Dense, modern, urgent | Large display type |
| Normal (0) | Neutral | Body text |
| Loose (+0.1em) | Open, luxury, elevated | Small caps, labels |

### Line-Height Philosophy
| Height | Effect | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Tight (1.1-1.2) | Dense, display | Headlines |
| Normal (1.4-1.5) | Readable | Body text |
| Loose (1.6-1.8) | Airy, premium | Pull quotes, luxury |

### Margin as Punctuation
White space between text blocks is a design decision. 

- Tight margins = connected ideas
- Generous margins = new thoughts
- Asymmetric margins = editorial tension

## Type Hierarchy That Works

### The 3-Size Rule
For any page: one display size, one heading size, one body size.

**Display:** 48-120px. The hero. The statement. Use sparingly.
**Heading:** 24-36px. Section titles. Navigation between ideas.
**Body:** 16-20px. Everything else.

### Weight Contrast
If sizes are limited, weights create hierarchy.

| Level | Weight |
|-------|--------|
| Display | 700 (Bold) or 300 (Light) for contrast |
| Heading | 500-600 (Medium) |
| Body | 400 (Regular) |

Light + Bold pairing creates more drama than two similar weights.

## Type-First Vibes

### Luxury Type
- Serif display (Cormorant at 300 weight)
- Sans body (Inter or Söhne)
- Generous letter-spacing on headings
- Large scale jumps
- Uppercase for labels with +0.15em tracking

### Minimal Type
- Geometric sans for both (Geist, Inter)
- Modest scale (1.25-1.333)
- Medium weights only (400-500)
- Tight letter-spacing on display
- Let whitespace do the work

### Editorial Type
- Serif display (Fraunces, Newsreader)
- Serif or sans body (depends on formality)
- Dramatic size contrast
- Pullquotes as design elements
- Variable weights for drama

### Playful Type
- Rounded or quirky sans (Satoshi, Bricolage)
- Bouncy weights
- Color on type
- Type at angles, overlapping
- Emojis integrated (when appropriate)

### Brutal Type
- Monospace for everything (JetBrains, Fira)
- Strict grid
- No weight variation
- UPPERCASE for headers
- Exposed structure (grid lines visible)

## Common Type Mistakes

### Too Many Typefaces
3 max. Usually 2. Sometimes 1.

### Weak Hierarchy
Everything looks the same importance. No focus.

### Display at Body Sizes
Display fonts are for display. 12px Bebas Neue is unreadable.

### Ignoring Line Length
60-80 characters for body. Wider = exhausting. Narrower = choppy.

### Same Weight Everywhere
Use weight for hierarchy. 400/500/600 differentiate as much as size.

## The Type Test

1. Remove all images. Does the site still have personality?
2. Squint. Is there clear hierarchy?
3. Could you identify the brand from typography alone?

If yes to all three, typography is doing its job.
