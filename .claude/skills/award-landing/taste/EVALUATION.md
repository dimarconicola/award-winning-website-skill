# Self-Evaluation Rubric

Before shipping, pass these tests. Award-winning sites score 8+ on all dimensions.

---

## The 5-Word Test
**Question:** Can you describe this site's concept in 5 words or less?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Instantly describable: "Watches as mechanical art" |
| 7 | Clear but takes a sentence |
| 4 | Vague: "Modern and professional" |
| 0 | Can't articulate it |

If you can't pass this test, go back to concept development.

---

## The Screenshot Test
**Question:** Is there ONE moment users will screenshot and share?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Obvious: hero interaction, product reveal, signature moment |
| 7 | Present but subtle, might be missed |
| 4 | Several minor moments, nothing standout |
| 0 | Nothing screenshot-worthy |

No signature moment = forgettable site.

---

## The Restraint Test
**Question:** Does every element serve the concept?

For each major element, ask: "Would removing this hurt the concept?"

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Nothing superfluous. Every element earned. |
| 7 | One or two decorative elements |
| 4 | Several elements that are "just nice" |
| 0 | Lots of decoration with no purpose |

If something exists "just because it looks cool," remove it.

---

## The Swap Test
**Question:** Would this feel like a different site if you swapped the logo?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Impossible to swap. Design IS the brand. |
| 7 | Logo swap would feel off, but possible |
| 4 | Could work for several similar brands |
| 0 | Generic template with logo placeholder |

Brand-agnostic designs don't win awards.

---

## The Hover Test
**Question:** Are the micro-interactions considered?

Jury members check:
- Button hover states
- Link underline behavior
- Card hover effects
- Cursor behavior
- Focus rings

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Every state designed. Custom cursor. Tactile buttons. |
| 7 | Primary interactions polished, others default |
| 4 | Basic hovers, browser defaults elsewhere |
| 0 | No hover consideration |

Details reward close inspection.

---

## The Speed Test
**Question:** Does it feel instant?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | LCP < 1.5s. Interactions immediate. 60fps scroll. |
| 7 | LCP < 2.5s. Mostly smooth. Occasional jank. |
| 4 | LCP 2.5-4s. Noticeable loading. Some lag. |
| 0 | LCP > 4s. Janky. Feels broken. |

Slow = cheap. Speed = luxury.

---

## The Reduced Motion Test
**Question:** Does it work without animations?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Fully usable with reduced motion. Content still clear. |
| 7 | Mostly works, some awkward static moments |
| 4 | Reduced motion breaks some layouts |
| 0 | Unusable without animations |

Accessibility is non-negotiable.

---

## The Mobile Test
**Question:** Does the mobile experience feel intentional, not compromised?

Jury members test on real devices:
- Touch targets (min 44px)
- Readable without zooming
- No horizontal scroll (unless intentional)
- Signature moment adapted or gracefully removed
- No hover-dependent functionality

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Mobile feels designed, not downsized. Intentional simplification. |
| 7 | Fully functional, some awkward moments |
| 4 | Works but feels like afterthought |
| 0 | Broken, unusable, or clearly desktop-only |

Mobile-first is the standard. Desktop-only disqualifies.

## The "Almost Award-Winning" Failures

### Failure Mode 1: Looks Designed, Feels Dead
Polished visuals, but no soul. No signature moment. Nothing memorable.

**Symptom:** "It's professional" is the best compliment it gets.
**Fix:** Add ONE signature interaction that embodies the concept.

### Failure Mode 2: Impressive Tech, No Purpose
The animations are complex. The WebGL is smooth. But why?

**Symptom:** "Cool demo" instead of "great site."
**Fix:** Ensure every tech choice serves the brand concept.

### Failure Mode 3: All Peaks, No Rest
Every section tries to be special. Motion never stops. Exhausting.

**Symptom:** Can't find the information. Feels heavy.
**Fix:** Establish quiet sections. Earn the peaks through restraint.

### Failure Mode 4: Pretty But Useless
Beautiful, but where's the CTA? What am I supposed to do?

**Symptom:** Design overshadows content and conversion.
**Fix:** Content-first. Design serves the message.

### Failure Mode 5: Copy/Paste Awwwards
Directly copying techniques from award winners without understanding why.

**Symptom:** Frankenstein of other sites' signature moments.
**Fix:** Develop YOUR concept. Let it generate unique expressions.

## The Final Gut Check

Before shipping, answer honestly:

1. **Would I stop scrolling if I saw this on Awwwards?**
2. **Would I share this with a designer friend?**
3. **Does this feel like an author made it, not a template?**

If all three are yes, ship it.
