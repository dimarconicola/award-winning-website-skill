# Worked Example: Flux

A developer productivity tool. Minimal SaaS done right.

---

## The Brief

> "Flux is a task management tool for developers. We help engineering teams stay in flow state. Clean, fast, keyboard-first. Think Linear but for personal productivity."

---

## Phase 1: Concept Extraction

### 1. What's the single truth about this brand?
"Flow state, protected."

Not task management — protecting the developer's most valuable resource: uninterrupted focus.

### 2. What metaphor embodies it?
**Water.** Continuous, adapting, finding the path of least resistance. Flow is liquid, not mechanical.

Visual implications:
- Soft, fluid motion (no hard stops)
- Cool palette (water, calm, focus)
- Clean surfaces (nothing to disrupt)
- Invisible UI (the tool disappears when working)

### 3. What feeling persists after?
**Capable.** Like you have a superpower. Focused, efficient, in control of your work instead of drowning in it.

### 4. What's the Signature Moment?
**Fluid task drag.** When dragging tasks between columns, they flow like water with soft physics — stretching slightly, settling smoothly. The interaction IS the metaphor.

## Phase 2: Vocabulary Selection

| Decision | Selection | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary Vibe | `minimal` | Clean, disappearing UI |
| Secondary Vibe | `technical` | Developer audience, precision |
| Motion Regime | `subtle` | Nothing distracting, everything smooth |
| Materiality | `glass` | Transparent, layered, modern |
| Style Cluster | `minimal-saas` | Perfect match |

### Reference DNA
| Site | What to Borrow |
|------|----------------|
| Linear | Polish level, keyboard-first vibe |
| Raycast | Speed as feature, instant feel |
| Superhuman | Premium SaaS positioning |

---

## Phase 3: Hierarchy Decisions

### 1. Typography
**Display:** Geist at 600 weight — modern, geometric, tech  
**Body:** Geist at 400 — same family, cohesive  
**Mono:** Geist Mono — code snippets, keyboard shortcuts

Scale: Minimal (1.25 ratio). No drama, all precision.

### 2. Layout Rhythm
- Centered hero with animated product demo
- Feature grid (3 columns, icons + text)
- Interactive demo section (try the keyboard shortcuts)
- Social proof (logos + quotes)
- Simple CTA

### 3. Color Restraint
| Role | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Background | #09090B | Near-black, focused |
| Foreground | #FAFAFA | Clean white |
| Accent | #3B82F6 | Electric blue — action, focus |

**Neutral scale:** 6 steps of gray for hierarchy

### 4. Motion Philosophy
"Motion should be invisible — you notice when it's gone, not when it's there."

- Fast transitions (200-300ms)
- Easing that ends crisply
- Keyboard triggers are instant
- Only the product demo has notable motion

### 5. Signature Moment
**Fluid task drag + keyboard shortcut demo.**

Two moments:
1. Product demo showing tasks flowing between columns with liquid physics
2. Interactive keyboard shortcut section — press keys, see instant response

## Phase 4: Self-Evaluation

| Test | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 5-Word Test | 10 | "Flow state, protected" |
| Screenshot Test | 8 | Fluid drag demo is the moment |
| Restraint Test | 10 | Extremely minimal, blue accent only |
| Swap Test | 9 | Feels like Flux, not generic SaaS |
| Hover Test | 8 | Subtle but considered states |
| Speed Test | 10 | Instant everything, tiny bundle |
| Reduced Motion | 10 | Works perfectly static |

# Creative Direction: Flux

## Design Thesis
> Invisible by design — a tool that protects flow state by getting out of the way.

## Mood Triad
1. **Fluid** — Motion that flows, not snaps; transitions that breathe
2. **Precise** — Pixel-perfect alignment; keyboard-first interactions
3. **Calm** — Cool palette; nothing competes for attention

## Style Classification
- **Primary Vibe:** minimal
- **Secondary Vibe:** technical
- **Cluster:** minimal-saas
- **Motion Regime:** subtle
- **Materiality:** glass

## Color Philosophy
| Role | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Background | #09090B | Focus mode |
| Foreground | #FAFAFA | Clean, readable |
| Accent | #3B82F6 | Action, primary CTA |

## Typography System
| Role | Font | Weight |
|------|------|--------|
| Display | Geist | 600 |
| Body | Geist | 400 |
| Mono | Geist Mono | 400 |

## Signature Moment
Fluid task drag with liquid physics. Tasks flow between columns like water.

## Reference DNA
- Linear: Polish obsession
- Raycast: Speed as value
- Superhuman: Premium positioning

## PAGE_PLAN.md Output

```markdown
# Page Structure: Flux

## Section Overview
| # | Section | Purpose | Layout |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Hero | Value prop + animated demo | Centered, product preview |
| 2 | Features | 3 key differentiators | 3-column grid |
| 3 | Demo | Try keyboard shortcuts | Interactive section |
| 4 | Proof | Who uses it | Logo bar + testimonials |
| 5 | CTA | Convert | Centered, minimal |
| 6 | Footer | Links | 4-column |

## Signature Moment
- **Location:** Hero product demo + Demo section
- **Interaction:** Fluid task drag, keyboard shortcuts

## Responsive Strategy

### Breakpoint Approach
| Breakpoint | Experience |
|------------|------------|
| Mobile (<768px) | Touch-optimized efficiency |
| Tablet (768-1024px) | Hybrid input support |
| Desktop (>1024px) | Full keyboard-first experience |

### Mobile Adaptations
| Desktop Feature | Mobile Adaptation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Keyboard shortcut demo | Removed (no keyboard) |
| Fluid task drag | Swipe gestures |
| Custom cursor | Hidden |
| 3-column features | Single column stack |
| Inline command palette | Bottom sheet modal |

### Touch Substitutes
| Hover State | Touch Equivalent |
|-------------|------------------|
| Hover preview | Tap to expand |
| Keyboard hints | Long-press tooltip |
| Magnetic buttons | Standard active states |

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- Touch targets: 44px minimum (developer tool = precision)
- Keep motion: Fluid physics still valuable on mobile
- Speed priority: Even more critical on mobile networks

## Key Decisions That Made It Award-Worthy

1. **Concept matches product** — Flow state tool has fluid motion
2. **Restraint as feature** — Minimal = focused = on-brand
3. **Speed is the signature** — Instant interactions, tiny bundle
4. **Developer audience acknowledged** — Keyboard-first, monospace details
5. **One accent color** — Blue only for actions, everything else neutral
