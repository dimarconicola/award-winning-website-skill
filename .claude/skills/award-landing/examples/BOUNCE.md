# Worked Example: Bounce

A playful consumer fitness app. Fun as strategy.

---

## The Brief

> "Bounce is a fitness app that makes working out feel like a game. We target young adults (18-30) who hate traditional fitness apps. We want something colorful, energetic, and memorable."

---

## Phase 1: Concept Extraction

### 1. What's the single truth about this brand?
"Exercise is play, not punishment."

Not another fitness tracker — a game that happens to make you healthier.

### 2. What metaphor embodies it?
**Playground.** Bouncy, colorful, surprising. The equipment you'd run to, not avoid.

Visual implications:
- Saturated colors (playground equipment)
- Bouncy motion (trampolines, balls)
- Rounded shapes (safe, inviting)
- Surprises and Easter eggs (games have secrets)

### 3. What feeling persists after?
**Energized.** Like you just saw something that made you want to move. Fun is possible. This isn't your boring gym app.

### 4. What's the Signature Moment?
**Bouncy physics cursor.** Elements bounce away when the cursor gets close, like ping pong balls. The "Get Started" button literally bounces with anticipation.

## Phase 2: Vocabulary Selection

| Decision | Selection | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary Vibe | `playful` | Color, bounce, fun |
| Secondary Vibe | `bold` | Confident, energetic |
| Motion Regime | `mixed` | Bouncy eases, stagger, physics |
| Materiality | `organic` | Soft, rounded, approachable |
| Style Cluster | `playful-brand` | Perfect match |

### Reference DNA
| Site | What to Borrow |
|------|----------------|
| Figma | Playful but professional balance |
| Arc Browser | Personality in product |
| Ponpon Mania | Physics-based delight |

---

## Phase 3: Hierarchy Decisions

### 1. Typography
**Display:** Bricolage Grotesque at 700 — chunky, friendly, bouncy  
**Body:** DM Sans at 400 — clean, readable, modern

Scale: Moderate (1.333 ratio). Bold headlines, approachable body.

### 2. Layout Rhythm
- Hero with bouncing elements, playful headline
- Feature cards at slight angles
- Animated phone mockups showing the app
- Testimonials as chat bubbles
- Bright CTA section

### 3. Color Restraint (In a Different Way)
Playful doesn't mean rainbow chaos. Strategic saturation.

| Role | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Background | #FFF8F0 | Warm white, friendly |
| Foreground | #1A1A2E | Soft black, not harsh |
| Primary | #FF6B35 | Energetic orange — main action |
| Secondary | #4ECDC4 | Teal — supporting |
| Accent | #FFE66D | Yellow — highlights |

**Rule:** Primary on CTAs, secondary on features, accent sparingly.

### 4. Motion Philosophy
"Motion should make you smile — bouncy, surprising, never still."

- Elastic easing everywhere
- Staggered entrances with personality
- Hover states that react, not just change
- Physics-based cursor interactions

### 5. Signature Moment
**Bouncy physics cursor + animated CTA button.**

1. Cursor pushes small elements around like a pool cue
2. "Get Started" button gently bounces with anticipation, explodes with confetti on click

# Page Structure: Bounce

## Section Overview
| # | Section | Purpose | Layout |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Hero | Energy + personality | Asymmetric, floating elements |
| 2 | Features | What makes it different | Tilted cards grid |
| 3 | App Demo | Show the product | Phone mockups with animation |
| 4 | Social Proof | Real people love it | Chat bubble testimonials |
| 5 | CTA | Convert | Bright, bouncy, confetti |
| 6 | Footer | Links | Playful but functional |

## Signature Moment
- **Location:** Everywhere (cursor), concentrated at CTA
- **Interaction:** Physics cursor, bouncing CTA, confetti

## Responsive Strategy

### Breakpoint Approach
| Breakpoint | Experience |
|------------|------------|
| Mobile (<768px) | Touch-friendly playfulness |
| Tablet (768-1024px) | Mixed input delight |
| Desktop (>1024px) | Full cursor physics |

### Mobile Adaptations
| Desktop Feature | Mobile Adaptation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Physics cursor | Removed |
| Hover interactions | Tap reactions + vibration |
| Tilted card grid | Swipe carousel |
| Confetti on CTA | Tap triggers burst |
| Floating elements | Simpler parallax |

### Touch Substitutes
| Hover State | Touch Equivalent |
|-------------|------------------|
| Bouncy cursor | Device vibration on tap |
| Card hover tilt | Swipe rotation |
| Magnetic button | Active state wobble |

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- Keep the bounce: Animation is the concept, don't kill it
- Touch targets: 48px (generous = more playful)
- Use device APIs: Haptic feedback, gyroscope if available
- Maintain energy: Color, motion, personality all translate
